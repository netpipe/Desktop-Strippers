# hot-tux

This is rework of well known hot-babe system workload monitor. Unlike [hot babe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKYQnLSKz6g&has_verified=1), which can be banned for many distributions due tu nudity, this implementation is making  the tux just little bit... different. As the transparency works in same mode as for [hot babe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hotbabe/) See on your own:

nothing is happening, machine and tux are bored:

not much is happening, tux still needs an coat:
![cold](./hb01/hb01_3.png)

it starting to be interesting
![ok](./hb01/hb01_2.png)

it starting to be bad
![warm](./hb01/hb01_1.png)

it is starting to be very bad
