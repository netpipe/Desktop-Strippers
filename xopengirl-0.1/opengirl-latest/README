******** INSTALLATION ******** 
	
* To compile it simply type make
* You need X11 libs and includes 
* do a make install to install them.  



******** USAGE ******** 

* You can run  opengirl in two ways : by specifying the directory ( with -d option ) 
  in which you have all your bk files; it will start randomly to show them until you ^C
  it .
  the second way is by specifying the files you want to show, after showing them 
  it will quit.
  
* These are the options 

	-d <directory>
	-h help
	-s <seconds>
	-f <integer>
	-x <x-axis offset>
	-y <y-axis offset>
	-z 
	
-d directory : is the dir in which you have the bk? files of virtuagirl 
	( usually /<path to win partition>/Program File/vg ) .

-h :shows the help

-s seconds : the seconds you want to wait between an animation and another 

-f integer : this is the delay in ms to display next frame (def 80000)
-x num : the offset from the left of your screen

-y num : the offset from the bottom of your screen

-z : the zoom for the girl ( it's cumulative .. try it :-))) )



when opengirl is running, you can change the girl by simply sending a -USR1 signal 
to the program with  killall -USR1 opengirl
